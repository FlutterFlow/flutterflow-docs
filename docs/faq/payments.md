## Payments & Billing

>What payment methods do you accept?

We currently accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and JCB.


>When will my credit card be charged?

 If you upgraded your account to a paid plan, we will charge your credit card on the same day each month. This typically will fall on the day that you originally upgraded your plan. If you received a free trial, your card will be charged on the day following the end of your trial period.

 At this time we are unable to process Gift Card payments. 


> I used the wrong credit card. Can I change it?</summary><br/>

Unfortunately, once your subscription has been purchased we are unable to change your payment method for this month. You can update future payments by changing your payment details.
