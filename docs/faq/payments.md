 If you upgraded your account to a paid plan, we will charge your credit card on the same day each month. This typically will fall on the day that you originally upgraded your plan. If you received a free trial, your card will be charged on the day following the end of your trial period.

Unfortunately, once your subscription has been purchased we are unable to change your payment method for this month. You can update future payments by changing your payment details.
